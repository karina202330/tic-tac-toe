# tic-tac-toe
My First Python terminal game

This is a simple 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game made using Python.It's my first Python project and I built it to learn how loops,conditions and functions work together.

#How to Run it:

1.Make sure you have Python installed.
2.Download the file 'tictactoe.py'.
3.Open your terminal and run it.


# Features

- Two-player turn-based gameplay
- Win condition checks (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Draw detection
- Prevents overwriting a filled cell
- Simple terminal-based interface
  

# What I Learned 

- Using lists and nested lists in Python
- Looping through 2D structures
- Writing and reusing functions
- Taking and validating user input
- Checking win conditions using logic

# How It Works
- The board is represented as a list of lists (3x3 grid).
- Players enter a number (1–9) corresponding to a position.
- The game checks for win/draw after each move.
- Uses simple Python functions and logic — perfect for beginners.
